			<br />
			<p>Every time we ship an order, we donate one roll of toilet paper to those in need.</p>

			<p>When you join Toilet Paper Society, you not only quit running out of toilet paper yourself, but you help someone in need with their daily toiletry needs.</p>

			<p>Help us help others through our partnership with Feeding America<sup>&reg;</sup>.</p><br />

				wholesome, as well as personal care items that cannot be purchased with
				SNAP benefits (formerly known as food stamps) such as shampoo, diapers,

				critical when we assist our member food banks in times of disaster.</p>
